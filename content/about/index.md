I am a developer passionate about building efficient, high-performance software that integrates seamlessly with hardware. My focus areas include firmware, systems, and kernel development, where I enjoy working close to the metal to solve complex, low-level challenges.

I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to impactful, forward-looking projects while continuing to grow as a systems developer. I value clean, reliable code and strive to deliver robust solutions that power real-world applications..
